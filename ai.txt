1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?

Yes

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?

Yes

3. How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm

The basic strategy is determine the 'x' coordinate of where to releasing the disk, because as long as I know the x, I can know the y
a. Find out legal moves. Legal move means the column whose first row has not been filled
b. Within all legal moves, if AI can win by a specific move(4 or more than 4 yellow ones are connected). Do it.
c. Within all legal moves, if player can win next, take up that grid to stop the player.
d. Since no one can win next, try to avoid the situation: AI put a yellow disk, then player has a possibility to win after that. I defined it as stupid moves, try to find out them. If there are more legal moves than stupid moves, minus stupid moves from legal moves.
e. Within remain moves, if AI can connect three disks, do it.
f. Within remain moves, if player can connect three disks, do it.
g. Within remain moves, if AI can connect two disks, do it.
h. Within remain moves, if player can connect two disks, do it.
i. None above, choose a random move.

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?

It is very hard to beat my computer. In most times I will lose or call it even. Due to the recent situation, no one tested it for me.

How would you improve it in the future?

I may add a strategy after Q3. part c, try to choose moves which have a hope to win. Because if there is no hope to win, connecting three or two disks are meanless. Then I will priorize moves within these movements.
